// Forms and Data Handling

// Handling form data with $_GET and $_POST superglobals
// Form validation and sanitization using filter_input() and filter_var()
// Preventing code injection with prepared statements or input sanitization 

// Form Methods
// GET -> Appends form data into the URL in name/value pairs. Useful when the data doesn't need to be secure (e.g search forms)
// POST -> Sends data inside the body of the HTTP request. More secure for sensitive data (e.g. passwords)

// Handling $_GET Data 
// When a form is submitted using the GET method, form data is appended to the URL as a query string and can be acessed using the $_GET superglobal
