<?php
    // Introduction to PHP 

    // -> PHP (Recursive acronym for PHP:Hypertext PreProcessor) is a server-side scripting language primarily used for web development

    // PHP is executed on the server, and is sent to the client's browser

    // PHP files have a .php extension and can contain a mix of HTML and PHP code


    // Basic Syntax 
    // PHP code is enclosed within <?php
    // Statements are terminated with a semi-colon ';'
    // PHP is a loosely-types language, but supports type declarations with data types. 
    // Comments can be single-line // or multi-line  /* */ 

    echo "Hello, Everyone!"; // This is a single-line comment

    /* This is a 
        multi-line
        comment
    */ 

    // Variables 
    // Variables start with '$' followed by the variable name 
    // Variables are dynamically typed based on their value
    // Common data types: integers, floats, strings, booleans, arrays, objects, null. 
    // Variable naming follows camelCase convention
