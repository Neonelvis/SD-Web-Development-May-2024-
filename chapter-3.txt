Chapter 3: Paragraphs, Headings and other heading tags 

Paragraphs: 
-> <p> element for creating paragraphs:

    - The <p> element represents a paragraph of text. 

    - It is a block-lebel element, meaning it starts on a new line and creates a vertical spacing before and after its content.

    - Paragraphs are essential for organising and structuring text content on web pages 

Formatting and Styling Paragraphs 
-> Paragraph text can be styled using CSS properties such as font-family, font-color, font-size, line-height, text-align, and margin 

Example: CSS styles for paragraphs 

p{
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
    line-height: 1.5;
    color: #333;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}

Proper Use of whitespace and line breaks 
-> HTMl collapses multiple consecutive whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and line breaks) into a single space. 
-> To create line breaks within a paragraph, use the <br> element 
-> The <br> element is an empty (self-closing) tag that inserts a line break 

Example: 
<p>This is a paragraph <br> with a line break.</br> 

Headings 
-> Importance of heading for structuring content 
-> Headings are used to define the hierachical structure of a web page or document 
-> They provide semantic meaning and aid in the organization and navigation of the content 
-> Search engines and assistive technologies use headings to understand the structure and context of the content 

Heading Levels (<h1> to <h6>) 
-> HTML provide six levels of headings, from <h1> (the highest level) to <h6> (the lowest level) 
-> <h1> is typically used for the main heading or title of a web page or document 
-> Subsequent heading levels (<h2>, <h3> etc) are used for subheading and subsections. 
-> Headings should be used in logical hierarchical manner, reflecting the outline and structure of the content. 

Proper use of heading tags for sematics and accessibility. 
-> Headings should be used to convey the meaning and structure of the content, not for visual styling purpose 
-> Skipping heading levels or using them out of order can confuse users and accessibility tools. 
-> Headings should be descriptive and concise, accurately representung the content they precede 


Other heading-related elements
1. <header> element for introductory content 
    -> The <header> represents a container for introductory or navigational content 
    -> It is commonly used to wrap the header section of a web page, which may include the site logo, main navigation menu, and other introductory elements. 
    -> The <header> element can be used at different levels, such as the entire page or for individual sections within the page. 

2. <nav> element for navigation menus 
    -> The <nav> element represents a section of links 
    -> It is typically used to wrap the main navigation menu, breadcrumbs trails, or other navigational elements on a web page. 
    -> Using the <nav> element improves the semantics and accessibility of navigation elements for screen readers and other assistive technologies

3. <footer> element for footer content
    -> The <footer> element represents a footer section for a web page or document 
    -> It is commonly used to contain information such as copyrights notices, contact information, sitemap links, and other related content. 
    -> Like the <header> element, the <footer> element can be used at different levels, for the entire page or for individual sections. 


Student Challenge: 
-> Build a simple blog post or article structure using paragraphs, headings and other relevant elements.
-> Use an <h1> element for the main title of the blog post or article 
-> Divide the content into sections using <h2> and <h3> elements as subheadings 
-> Wrap the introductory content, such as the author's name and publication date, within the <header> element 
-> Include a <footer> element at the bottom of the post or article, containing addtional information like tags, categories, or related links. 
-> Use CSS to style the paragraphs, headings and other elements for a visually appealing layout
